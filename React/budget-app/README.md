# What is this?
This is a budget tracking app that allows users to handle their month-to-month budget by creating a template for different categories they wish to split their income to cover. Then allows them to add their expenses as they occur into predefined or uncategorized buckets. On top of that, it shows summarized view of expense total, and uses color scheme to show how well (or not) the user is sticking to the budget. Enjoy!
