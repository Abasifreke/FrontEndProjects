### Goal
TLDR: Continuous learning for frontend tech.

As the landscape of frontend technologies keeps evolving, with completely newer frameworks, newer versions of old tools, the influence of AI, etc... The goal of this repo is to host my front-end-focused practice projects. This will be my sandbox for playing with React, Vue, Nextjs, Tailwind, and pretty much recent tooling to keep up to date with Frontend technologies.
